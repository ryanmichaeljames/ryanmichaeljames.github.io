My name is Ryan James and I'm a Dynamics developer at [Intergen](https://www.intergen.co.nz/). Being a Dynamics developer means I'm a jack of all trades, and I spend my time building custom D365, PowerApps, Portals and Azure solutions.

I was born in South Africa but I'm current living and working int the land of the long white cloud, New Zealand.

If i'm not building something then either I'm playing [SQUAD](https://joinsquad.com/) or fighting my toddler for the Play Station 4 controller.
