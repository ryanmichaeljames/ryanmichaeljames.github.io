There are a few community made PCF controls out there that consume the [AddressFinder](https://addressfinder.nz/) API allowing you to search for New Zealand and Australian addresses, but I wasn't happy with any of them. They were either under maintained or didn't offer enough customisation options. So, I created my own... [PFC AddressFinder Widget](https://github.com/ryanmichaeljames/pcf-addressfinder-widget) ðŸ˜Ž

## PCF AddressFinder Widget
{:class="anchored"}

I created an open source PCF control that uses the [AddressFinder Widget](https://addressfinder.nz/docs/widget_docs) to search for addresses and populate the address fields of any Dynamics 365 or CDS entity.

## Installation
{:class="anchored"}

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ryanmichaeljames/pcf-addressfinder-widget/releases/latest) from the [pcf-addressfinder-widget](https://github.com/ryanmichaeljames/pcf-addressfinder-widget) repository on GitHub and import the solution into your Dynamics 365 or CDS instance.

## Setup
{:class="anchored"}

Add the AddressFinder Widget control to your Line 1 address field and configure the address fields you wish to populate by mapping them to the control's properties.

Add your AddressFinder API key to the `API Key` property and configure any additional options to meet your requirements. If you need an API key you can [register](https://portal.addressfinder.net/signup/nz/nz_free5) for a free account that gives you 500 free address lookups a month.
