So you are looking to try out the new PowerApps features, planning on doing a PowerApps demo or just want to learn what PowerApps is all about? The best place to start is with a free trial without having to link your credit card. In this blog post I'll show you how to signup of a free 3 month PowerApps [Plan 2](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/#compare-plans) trial.

## Office 365 E5 Trial
{:class="anchored"}

 Fist off, you will need to create an Office 365 E5 Trial.

> Log out of all Microsoft accounts before signing up for the trial. This will prevent you from creating a trial on behalf of your organization or personal account when you dont intend to.

Browse to [https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/microsoft-365/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans](https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/microsoft-365/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans) and click the **Try for free** link under the Office 365 E5 option.

Enter a valid email address and click **Next** and then click **Set up account**.

Enter your details and click **Next**.

Now you need to provide that you are a [real human being](https://youtu.be/kNdDROtrPcQ) by providing a vaild phone number that can receive a verification code via text message or phone call. Unfortunately web generated phone numbers don't work.

> If you have created too many trials using the same phone number then you may have to use a new number or borrow a college or friend's mobile number.

Give your trial a business identity and click **Next**. I prefer to use a randomly generated string of letters. This way I don't steal a valid name from someone who may wish to use it in the future.

Enter a user ID and password. This will be the account we will use to login to Office 365 and the Power Platform. Click **Sign up**.
